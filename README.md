ðŸ§  App Logic (To-Do List using Dart)
Main Structure
  main() runs the MainApp widget using runApp().
  MainApp is a StatefulWidget because tasks will change dynamically.

UI Layout
  A Scaffold is used to build the basic layout (AppBar, Body).
  The UI contains a text input field, add button, and a list of tasks.

Task Input
  TextEditingController captures input from the user.
  When the "Add" button is pressed:
  The current input from the text field is added to the tasks list.
  The UI updates using setState().

Task Display
  A ListView.builder dynamically creates a list of widgets based on the tasks list.
  Each item is displayed with:

Task text
Delete icon

Delete Task
  When the delete icon is pressed:
  The corresponding task is removed from the list using removeAt(index).

UI updates again with setState().
